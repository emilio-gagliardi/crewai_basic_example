The Edmonton Waste Water Treatment plant is an integrated processing and transfer facility that helps process and treat wastewater in the city. The facility plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality of waterways and protecting the environment. It uses state-of-the-art technologies to provide efficient and cost-effective wastewater treatment solutions.

The Integrated Processing and Transfer Facility (IPTF) is a $400 million project that was completed in 2016, replacing an older plant that had been operating for more than 80 years. The IPTF can handle up to 587 million liters of wastewater per day, and it uses advanced technologies such as membrane bioreactors, anaerobic digestion, and UV disinfection to ensure that the treated water meets stringent quality standards.

The Edmonton Waste Management Centre also includes other facilities that help with waste disposal and recycling. These include the Recycle Edo waste management program, which encourages residents to reduce waste by recycling, composting, and donating to charities. The centre also operates a hazardous waste facility, which is responsible for safely managing and disposing of hazardous waste materials.

In summary, the Edmonton Waste Water Treatment plant plays a vital role in ensuring the quality of water in the city, and the IPTF uses advanced technologies to provide efficient wastewater treatment solutions. The centre also includes other facilities that help with waste disposal and recycling, such as the Recycle Edo waste management program and the hazardous waste facility.
